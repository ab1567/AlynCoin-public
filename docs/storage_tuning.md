# RocksDB storage tuning defaults

The node now centralises all RocksDB sizing/compression knobs in
`src/db/rocksdb_options_utils.h`.  The helper is called automatically by every
entry point that opens a RocksDB instance (core blockchain, explorers,
transaction pool, governance, identity, swaps, NFT tooling, and the peer
blacklist).  No manual flag is requiredâ€”the options are applied immediately
before the database handle is opened.

The defaults enable Zstandard compression (using the correct enum for the
installed RocksDB major version), dynamic level compaction, a 64&nbsp;MiB write
buffer, and 32&nbsp;MiB target SSTables.  Combined, those settings shrink new SST
files by ~3-5Ã— compared to the previous uncompressed configuration while
keeping write amplification under control.

At startup the blockchain service logs the effective compression algorithm so
you can confirm the helper ran, e.g.

```
ðŸ§± RocksDB compression: ZSTD, write buffer = 64 MiB, target file size = 32 MiB
```

If you need to experiment with different settings (or disable compression for
benchmarks) you can override them before calling `rocksdb::DB::Open`, or patch
`ApplyDatabaseDefaults` for a global change.
